FOR A RAINY AFTERNOON

Nothing to do?
Nothing to do?
Pour some ketchup in your shoe.
Bang a drum and clang a bell,
Pinch the baby till he yells.
Spin around until you fall,
Draw a picture on the wall.
Put some marbles on the stair,
Stick some glue in Sister's hair.
Suck your thumb and slam the doors,
Pull out all the dresser drawers.
Catch the cat and bit his ear,
Soak your toes in Uncle's beer.
Fill your pockets full of soot,
Paint the bottom of your foot.
Take your grandpa's watch and boil it,
Throw the car keys down the toilet.
Wet your pants in Daddy's lap,
Now go upstairs and take your nap.
- Shel Silverstein
