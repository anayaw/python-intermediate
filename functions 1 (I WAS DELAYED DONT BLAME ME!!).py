### TYPE 2 EXAMPLES
##def double(x): # our parameter is x, which can be anything

### what happens when you call this function with 1 argument?
### TYPE 3 EXAMPLES

##def is_adult(age):

### this function has multiple return statements, but you can see that
### no matter what argument is passed in for 'age', it always returns
### just one value. There is no way the code can reach both returns!
##
##a = is_adult(89) # what is stored in variable a?
##if is_adult(10): # if is adult(10) evaluates to True, it will print
##    print("10 year olds are adults") # will this be printed?
##user_age = int(input("How old are you?" ))
##if is_adult(user_age): # it only prints if they enter 18 or higher
##    print("You are an adult.")
##is_adult(99) # where is the return value going here?
